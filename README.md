# hello-world
The first coding related thing i ever made in my whole life experience on earth.
I am a 20 years old man and i've born in Brazil, more expecifically at the city of Florianopolis, Santa Catarina. When i was younger i liked doing sports and creative things such as skating and drawing. At the age of 14 i started playing an old guitar from my dad and just fell in love with music, since the first day i touched the guitar i never stopped playing except for one time when the woman who works cleaning my house every two weeks let if fall from the dangerous place i used to keep it. After college i felt lost about choosing a profession and i believe it brought me mental wealth problems, the pressure from my mom actually helped it, and i believe i was treated like a child until this day, and she simply wanted me to act, feel and think like a man from one day to the other. At the age of 19 i made a bike trip that i believe have prepeared me for life, at least a little bit, and now a have a clearer view of what work is about and how i should prepear myself to this world. First thing i am doing after this trip is learning programming.
